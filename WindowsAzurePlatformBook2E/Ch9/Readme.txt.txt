There are excellent code samples readily available that demostrate this technology.

I strongly recommend downloading the latest version of the Windows Azure AppFabric Samples. The latest release at the time of writing can be found at:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee706741

There are three samples that reflect the topics covered in this sample set:

- CacheAPISample:	Demonstrates the various AppFabric Caching API calls in a simple console application.
- TrySessionCloud:	Illustrates how to use the ASP.NET session state providers with AppFabric Caching.
- WebRole: 		Demonstrates the use of AppFabric Caching in an ASP.NET application that is hosted in Windows Azure.
